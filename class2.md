 # Introducing CSS
 
 - * CSS allows you to create RULES that specify how the content of an element should appear.*
 - Once you've learned how to properly write a CSS rule, learning CSS involves learning the propteries you can use WITH THAT.
 
 ## Block vs Line elements.
 - Block level elements look like how they start on a new line.
 . Ex: 
 1. <h1>
 2. <p>
 3. <div> elements.
  *Inline elements flow within the text, do not start on a new line.*
  Ex: <img>, <em> and <span>.
  
  
  ### Rules with HTML elements
  - CSS works by associating RULES with HTML elements. These rules GOVERN how the content of specified elements should be displayed. A CSS rule contains two parts.
  1. Selector.
  2. Declaration.
  
  - CSS Propterties affect how elements are displayed.
